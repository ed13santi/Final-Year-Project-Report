\chapter{Ethical, Legal, and Safety Plan}

Following a brief consultation with my project supervisor, I can state that this project does not involve any kind of ethical,
legal, or safety issues. 

\paragraph{Ethical Issues} The project does not involve experimentation with humans or animals and it is not going to cause any
physical or psychological harm to any participants. 

\paragraph{Legal Issues} The project doesn't involve the participation of people in surveys or any kind of collection of sensitive
data, meaning that privacy is not an issue. This is an open research project and it is not affected by any copyrights or
confidentiality agreements. This work is also not affected by any existing patents. \paragraph{Safety Issues} The project work is
extremely unlikely to cause any physical harm as it doesn't involve the operation of dangerous equipment involving any high
voltages, chemicals, flammable materials, biological hazards, etc.
